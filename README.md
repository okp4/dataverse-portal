These instructions will get you a project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Be sure to have the following properly installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ru/) `v18.13` ([hydrogen](https://nodejs.org/ru/blog/release/v18.13.0/))
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Setup

üöö Install the dependencies and build the project:

```sh
yarn

yarn build
```

### Environment variables

The project relies on several environment variables for proper functioning. These variables should be set in a file named `.env.local` at the root of the project.
Checkout [nextjs documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for more.

```shell
# The title of the application that will be displayed in the browser's title bar.
APP_TITLE=
# A comma-separated list of keywords relevant to the application (used by search engines).
APP_KEYWORDS=
# A brief description of the application (used by search engines).
APP_DESCRIPTION=
```

Note that the `.env.local` file is not tracked by version control and should not be committed to the repository.

### Launch

Run the server with the following command line.

```sh
yarn start
```

The portal will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.
